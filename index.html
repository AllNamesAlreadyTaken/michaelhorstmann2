              <div class="well">
                  My name is Michael Horstmann and I really like JavaScript.  I'm familiar with several webapp concepts on the front-end and back-end and I really enjoy coding in NodeJS. My ideal position would have me working daily with JavaScript and web technologies. I like learning new things and technologies and I'm always keeping up with current tech.  I have been specializing in legacy system updates.  At my most recent position I brought original CSS up to CSS3 and XHTML that was becoming inaccessible in modern browsers into the more modern HTML5 document format.  I'm very social and I find that to be very beneficial in the workplace.  Being social and liking a lot of different things helps me a great deal when explaining "techie stuff" to other departments.  Recently, I've started offering tutoring [<a href="mailto:MHorstmann15228@gmail.com">click to inquire</a>] for HTML/CSS/JS basics. Tutoring has been very rewarding and exciting.  I really enjoy seeing a concept "click" for someone the first time.  I know they appreciate the opportunity to have someone explain what seems like complex processes to them simply.<hr>

		         <small>Web Reporting on business intelligence and predictive analytics.  Domestic and international logistics for many shipping providers processed in desktop software written in .NET.</small>
		      </div>
              <p class="lead">I was initially hired at ShipMatrix to polish some applications for public release because of my design background with a high degree of technical skill.  In the first quarter, I became responsible for the current flagship application, which was a multiple format invoide data reader and translator tool.  I performed data analysis in SQL Server on over 400 databases.  I also redesigned existing reports to be HTML5 and CSS3 compliant while improving the user experience and server overhead. I worked with Domestic and international Logistics using Microsoft shop tools and a javascript powered content management system called <a href="http://www.logianalytics.com/">LogiAnalytics</a>. We leveraged code written in SQL and C# and I helped to create useful front-end capabilities optimizing pages and accessibility via jQuery and Angular.  We managed physical server hardware internally where I was able to utilize some unix scripting and create small ubuntu servers for streamlining add-in processes the LogiAnalytics CMS did not yet offer.  I've had the opportunity to develop ground up technologies to manage SQL Server databases using NodeJS, vanilla JavaScript, EXPRESS, and styling frameworks like bootstrap. I successfully trudged the web presence through updating the outdated XHTML and CSS1 layouts to modern, flexible HTML5/CSS/JS. I also pushed for "git" integration and pulled a lot of new projects towards well formed open source software.  I was not initially hired to perform such a large list of duties but showed great comprehension and was given more responsibilities with each succesful task, integration, and enhancement.</p><span class='extend'>More...</span>

Working with robotically autonomous collection data. Video, laser, gas, incline, 360&#176; images initially databased in MSAccess. Theses were edited, quality controllance assured and uploaded to a SQL Server powered "municipal asset management and review" tool.</small>
		      </div>
		        <p class="lead">I was with RedZone Robotics over 3 and a half years. I developed an entire company overview of documentation, department capabilities, and global flowchart of try/fail scenarios with the appropriate person to assist if needed at each level. This was my first professional job, and while I was humbled by working with several of Carnegie Mellon's finest minds it was a fantastic company to grow with. Working alongside the smartest minds of Carnegie Mellon's robotics, mathematics, and business schools was an honor and I've maintained friendships with several of my colleagues through the years.  With Redzone I performed data anlysis and worked with custom built desktop software. Performing tier I QAQC on software and data.  I catalogued and updated the company's documentation repository to include the newest most up to date informations. I was responsible for developments of the flagship (MSI) product responder aligning cctv, laser data in XML format, MSAccess databases, incline data, gas logs, and 360&#176; images formatted to a single final data track.  We managed hardware inventory as we sent out data to the customer on HDD and SD drives with finalized data.  We were closely involved in interdepartmental communications through the development of custom internal software written in C# to combined the data tracks.  We issued small SQL Server updates to the customer SQL databases and ran Matlab scripts that utilized open office to create formatted printed paper reports in addition to digital copies.  Lastly I helped update the department's workstations with new hard drives, RAM, and operating systems (xp to 7) and utilized <a href="https://ninite.com/">ninite</a> to rapidly install clean versions of the base softwares required for day to day business operations.</p><span class='extend'>More...</span>

		      </div>
		        <p class="lead">Initially enrolled at ITT-Tech as a programmer, I had some trouble ramping up to speed without any prior computer coding experience.  I struggled finding my rhythm towards the end of the first year.  I felt that I would have excelled in this course with some high school courses prior to this accelerated program.  Instead of allowing defeat I met with the head of the IT department and discussed a multimedia major with a web development and digital design focus. In this new coursework I was able to focus on more beginner focused topics and methods.  I was able to turn my entire educational background around graduating with honors and invitated to join in the National Technical Honor Society from the school's Dean. The path taken to eventual success at ITT-Tech taught me a critical lesson in perserverance and created a strong foundation of persistence and adaptability. Creating a positive experience in education and planting an insatiable appetite for knowledge and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge through lifelong education.</p>
