<ul>Reasons for leaving SM
Inability to handle - continuous innovation (continually trying to implement old ideas or to administrate correctly existing ideas - no new sofwtare mgr processes being invented/administered)

No move to "Better/Faster/Cheaper" methods.  Continually "it's good enough, let's just make new reports."

Heavy restrictions, no procedures (in a bad, unorganized manner), processes were static and slow with high resource costs

Excessive custom work for every contract/customer - Bad biz model, actually, literally NO biz model or plan. "I want to have happy employees" was LITERALLY the business plan.

High technical and organization debts, with no moves to refactor and clean up those asset debts.

No plan to use cloud to capitalize on scaling capabilities (infoquest servers had around 80% up time at best. No clear network maps or ip lists)

No innovation, very short sighted upon goals. (one product update after another for highly custom one off functions, no code freezes, solving bugs for existing features without any accountability, while designing and testing newer releases with newer bugs and less functional features.)

Company unable to chew gum AND walk at the same time.  Either fix a product, or work on
a product, with very little labor attached to either. Randy's notepad management, and
printouts of emails/db's/queries etc.  NEVER utilizing tech to become more capable at
managing led to harsh mismanagement.

Customer problems remained "customer problems" That's not our issue if it's not billable
mentality and attitude.

Focus on solving current problems, no focus on future problems "manager quoted it as solving world hunger to do any 'future planning' in dev and design causing major labor
costs further on in the project cycles."

Poor customer relationships, always offering "this is too technical for you to understand so you're going to give up asking before we get to a solution." excuses.  

Little to no interdepartmental communication led to extremely reduced product demand and
customer interaction.  Crippling "useful productions and developements" to offer "theoretically useful products and developments."
