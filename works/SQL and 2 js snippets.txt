SQL Server:

“selecting as json” - Simple tool to select SQL 2008 R2 records as JSON. Will be irrelevant in SQL 2016 where you will be able to natively output as JSON.
I used this select statement to creates VIEWS that generated JSON to consume on the front end.

“LookupTableQuery” - Simple script to dynamically find any records with a field of a given value.  I used this to run queries where I wasn’t sure of what I was looking for, but also to parse every column without having to type them out repeatedly. Later turned into a stored procedure.

“InternalFBOPInvoiceAuditsByDateWorking” - Script to dynamically query into our 2 public data servers INET/INETD for any missing files by fileName.

“AppInsightMasterProcess” - Master Process I initiated on the ServicePC a coworker and I dedicated to building the “AppInsight” tool from. Goes through the available machines and updates tables 3x/day where the query defines it to do so.

“Internal FBOP Audits By Invoice date” Script to check for FBOP invoices by a given date range.  Checks several different areas dynamically.

JS:
“AsciiArtName.js” - Fun little addition I’m going to push to my website to add my name in ascii art on document ready.

"osDetailsNodeJS" - JS script to run in nodeJS to get relevant OS stats.
