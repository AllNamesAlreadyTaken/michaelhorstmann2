    <p>Function to convert a table into an object to pass into a new page.</a> As is this will just cycle the table and print out the conversion in the console.  This was used at ShipMatrix to parse through a table and get the table cell values.  The next step was to convert the values into divs as Google print option has trouble applying table styles to print jobs.</p>

    <p>This was a multi SQL engine I built to connect to several VM instances which all had different versions of SQL Server running on them.  The goal was to manage 400 or so SQL Server databases from 1 front end application and use a backend nodejs app to patch into any version of SQL Server.  The server within is capable of connecting not just to MSSQL, but to Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Mongo, and other RDBM system engines as well.  Creating a universal SQL engine connection. The end goal was to connect to all 28 servers running different versions of SQL and send critical data to the front end application view to manage a vastly increased amount of databases with a high degree of accuracy over the existing "manage by exception" structure.</p>
